subtitle: the (not so) unstoppable exchange for trading Ethereum tokens

<p>Unfortunately, while technically innovative, UbiTok.io’s totally decentralized exchange technology has not proven commercially successful.</p>

<p>In particular, paying Ethereum gas costs for each order placed or cancelled was unattractive to market makers - and without market makers, it’s hard to attract casual users.</p>

<p>Regrettably, the UbiTok.io exchange was <strong>permanently shutdown in July 2018</strong>.</p>

<p><em>(Being unstoppable, the exchange smart contracts will continue to function as long as the Ethereum network is willing to execute them - but it’s hard to interact with them without the UI ...)</em></p>

<p>Thank you to all our users and token creators for your support.</p>
